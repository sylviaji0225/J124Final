# Increase in Accidental Drug Related Deaths in Connecticut from 2012 to 2022
## By Sylvia Ji
### Story pitch
A new report published early July by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System between 2011 and 2021.Drug overdose deaths involving both cocaine and opioids have spiked over the last decade, new federal data suggests.

In the state of Connecticut, a parallel situation unfolds. Following the investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, the state government has compiled data spanning from 2012 to 2022, encompassing cases of accidental deaths due to drug overdose. Throughout this period, the count of accidental deaths linked to drug overdose experiences an almost annual surge, albeit with a somewhat decelerated pace since 2017. Strikingly, the tally of fatalities in 2022 stands at approximately fourfold of that in 2012.

These tragic events find concentration within counties such as Hartford and New Haven. The majority of these fatality instances gravitate towards individuals aged 30 and above. Over a span of a decade, an alarming count of 241 minors (below 21 years of age) have tragically succumbed due to drug abuse. As nbcnews previously reported, a 13-year-old died days after a suspected fentanyl overdose at a Connecticut middle school in 2022. 

Specific drug detection data underscores that Fentanyl (an opioid), cocaine, and heroin claim the top three slots for highest detected substance concentrations within the deceased bodies. This array of data poignantly underscores the grave impact of drug abuse within the state.

The information above is primarily derived from an analysis of the dataset, from which it can be observed that there is a rising trend in accidental deaths caused by drug abuse. It also provides a rough depiction of the profile of the deceased individuals. However, there is still a significant amount of information that cannot be presented.In the formal report, I also want to introduce the following perspective: Why drug abuse is becoming more common in the United States? Is there any way to solve the problem? For what reason were these people exposed to these drugs? Additionaly, in the last year, the state has taken a lot of steps to address substance abuse, has it produced real results?
